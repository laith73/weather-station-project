# Project Description

This is a design of a weather station device that provides multiple essential metrics used in real-world weather scenarios. This device can be used in various settings, including homes, farms, and offices, allowing users to gain insight into the weather without leaving the comfort of their own place. Additionally, the device provides a simple web dashboard that can be accessed locally to display the sensors' readings on the user's computer or phone, as well as a small OLED display on the device for easy local monitoring.

This repo contains all of the KiCad project files, reports, and datasheets for the parts used.
